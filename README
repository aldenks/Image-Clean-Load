Fade in images after they are fully loaded.

   Images must have their intended src attribute set as attribute data-src
      and have an empty or placeholder src attr. As always, set width and
      height attributes on images to maintain page layout as they load.

   Takes an options object which effects how the images fades in. It supports
      all the properties defined here:

   Default duration is 0 to help performace.

   Usage Examples:
     $('img').cleanLoad();

     $('img.large').cleanLoad({
                       duration: 'slow',
                       easing: 'swing',
                       complete: function (){ console.log("complete."); }
                    });
